## [Unreleased]

### Added

### Changed

### Deprecated

### Removed

### Fixed

### Security

### Breaking Changes

## cp_amm [0.2.0]

### Added

- Pool now will track reserves balances `(token_a_amount, token_b_amount)` if `pool.layout_version == 1`. For pool layout_version 0, operator can call the new endpoint `fix_pool_layout_version` to pump pool version.
- Add a new `collect_fee_mode (Compounding)`, in the new collect fee mode, fee will be collected in quote token, and a percentage of fee (configurable) will be added in reserves for compounding. In the new collect fee mode, the pool doesn't have concentrated price range, instead following constant-product formula `token_a_amount * token_b_amount = constant`.
- Endpoints `create_config`, `initialize_customizable_pool` and `initialize_pool_with_dynamic_config` will allow user to create pool with `collect_fee_mode == Compounding`, and config for `compounding_fee_bps`.

### Changed

- Related to event `EvtSwap2`, in `swap_result` field, `partner_fee` will be replaced by `compounding_fee`, now total_trading_fee will be calculated as `swap_result.claiming_fee + swap_result.compounding_fee`

### Removed

- Removed `partner` field from Pool struct
- Removed unused `partner_fee` feature and the `claim_partner_fee` endpoint

### Breaking Changes

- Quote function will be changed by the new fee mode

## cp_amm [0.1.8][PR #177](https://github.com/MeteoraAg/damm-v2/pull/177)

### Added

- New endpoint `fix_pool_params` and `fix_config_fee_params` to allow `operator` to fix invalid scheduler params that causes blocking operation on `update_pool_fees` endpoint.
- New endpoint `lock_inner_position`, that allow to vest liquidity without external `Vesting` account for better composability.

### Changed

- Endpoint `split_position` and `split_position2` will split `InnerVesting` of the `Position` account

## cp_amm [0.1.7] [PR #124](https://github.com/MeteoraAg/damm-v2/pull/167)

### Added

- New endpoint `zap_protocol_fee` that allow operator to claim protocol fees and zap out to SOL/USDC or other token in pool and send to treasury address

### Changed

- Allow whitelisted program to bypass stack height check for rate limiter enabled pool

## cp_amm [0.1.6] [PR #124](https://github.com/MeteoraAg/damm-v2/pull/124)

### Added

- Add 2 new modes for base fee: fee by marketcap linear and fee by marketcap exponential, fee will be reduced when current price increases from initial price
- Add new endpoint `create_operator_account` and `close_operator_account`that allows admin to manage different operator accounts
- Add new account `Operator`, that would stores `whitelisted_address` as well as their operational permissions
- Add new endpoint `update_pool_fees` that allows operators to update pool fees (both base fee and dynamic fee) for specific pools.

### Changed

- Remove constraints for quote tokens (SOL/USDC), affected endpoints: `initialize_pool_with_dynamic_config` and `initialize_customizable_pool`
- Update current pool version to 1, that changes max fee of new created pools to 99%
- Implement no-sdt (pinocchio) for swap and swap2 endpoint, that reduces CU for those functions. Before optimization: 47k, after optimization: 30k

### Removed

- Remove feature `devnet` when building program

### Breaking Changes

- Quote function will be changed by 2 new fee modes.
- All admin endpoints now will requires `whitelisted_address` and `operator` instead of raw admin account. Those affected endpoints: `close_claim_fee_operator`, `close_config`, `create_claim_fee_operator`, `close_token_badge`, `create_dynamic_config`, `create_static_config`, `create_token_badge`, `initialize_reward`, `set_pool_status`, `update_reward_duration`, `update_reward_funder`
- Event `EvtSwap`, `EvtRemoveLiquidity` and `EvtAddLiquidity` are removed.

## cp_amm [0.1.5] [PR #122](https://github.com/MeteoraAg/damm-v2/pull/122)

### Added

- Allow partner to config another mode for base fee, called rate limiter. With the mode is enable, fee slope will increase if user buy with higher amount. The rate limiter mode is only available if collect fee mode is in token b token only, and when user buy token (not sell). Rate limiter doesn't allow user to send multiple swap instructions (or CPI) to the same pool in 1 transaction
- Add new endpoint `swap2`, that includes 3 `swap_mode`: 0 (ExactIn), 1 (PartialFill) and 2 (ExactOut)
- Emit new event in 2 swap endpoints `EvtSwap2`, that includes more information about `reserve_a_amount`, `reserve_b_amount`
- Emit new event `EvtLiquidityChange` when user add or remove liquidity

### Changed

- Support permissionless for token2022 with transfer hook extension if both transfer hook program and transfer hook authority have been revoked

### Deprecated

- Event `EvtSwap`, `EvtRemoveLiquidity` and `EvtAddLiquidity` are deprecated

### Fixed

- Using `saturating_sub` instead of `safe_sub` for `elapsed` calculation

### Breaking Changes

- In swap instruction, if rate limiter is enable, user need to submit `instruction_sysvar_account` in remaining account, otherwise transaction will be failed
- Quote function can be changed by rate limiter

## cp_amm [0.1.4]

### Added

- Add new endpoint `split_position2` that allows position's owner to split position with better resolution

### Breaking Changes

- `split_position` will not emit event `EvtSplitPosition`, instead of emitting event `EvtSplitPosition2`

## cp_amm [0.1.3]

### Added

- Add new endpoint `split_position` that allows position's owner to split position.

### Changed

- Loosen protocol and partner fee validation on program
- Optimize for pool authority seed calculation
- Make swap fields public
- Update quote function in sdk, add a condition for swap enabled

### Breaking Changes

- `EvtInitializeReward` emit more fields: `creator`, `reward_duration_end`, `pre_reward_rate` and `post_reward_rate`

## cp_amm [0.1.2]

### Added

- New endpoint for admin to close token badge `close_token_badge`
- Pool state add a new field `creator`, that records address for pool creator

### Changed

- Allow pool creator to initialize reward at index 0 permissionlessly
- Endpoint `update_reward_duration` update `admin` account to `signer` account
- Endpoint `update_reward_funder` update `admin` account to `signer` account
- Some bug fixs from audtior

### Breaking Changes

- Endpoint `claim_protocol_fee` add new parameters `max_amount_a` and `max_amount_b` to limit number of tokens to claim from a pool
- Endpoint `initialize_reward` update `admin` account to `signer` account, and add `payer` account in instruction
- Endpoint `claim_reward` requires new parameter `skip_reward`, when user submit instruction with that flag, then if `reward_vault` is frozen, user can still reset pending rewards

## cp_amm [0.1.1]

### Added

- New endpoint for admin to create a dynamic config key
- New endpoint to create pool from a dynamic config key
- Config state add a new field config_type, that defines static config or dynamic config

### Changed

- Change parameters for endpoint create_config
